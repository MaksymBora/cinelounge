## Description:

The user has the ability to register their account, verify their email, and
fully utilize the watchlist feature, where they can keep a list of all the
movies they want to watch. There's an option to change the avatar. Additionally,
a multifunctional filter for movies or series works excellently alongside
pagination. There's a keyword or title search function. Users can view trailers,
image galleries of movies, and a list of all actors and crew. There's also the
capability to view detailed information about a specific actor, navigate to
their social media page, or view a list of popular movies featuring that actor
and watch trailers for those movies.

## Project deployed on:

The frontend is deployed on Netlify server with a custom domain, and the backend
is deployed on Render server.
